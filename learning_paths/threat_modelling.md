## Summary
- Early and often, threat model all the time

- Results in fewer bugs, smaller attack surface

- About finding problems in the process early so they can be fixed

- Ensure security is fixed in the application as it is being developed.

- Encourages a security mindset in team members such as engineers and developers.


The following example provides a high level, simplification of what threat modelling is.

### Example
> When you leave the house with a child to walk them to school. As you leave you see cars driving past, a dog barking in the street, the sun is beating down with intense heat. So, you hold the child’s hand to cross the road (this is identifying a threat from vehicles), you might apply sunscreen to yourself or the child to prevent sunburn (threat from the heat identified). You might try to avoid the barking dog as it seems aggressive (threat identified).
