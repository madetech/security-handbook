# DevSecOps

## DevSecOPS (Development Security Operations)
“DevSecOps is about built-in security, not security that functions as a perimeter around apps and data.

“Environment and data security

Standardize and automate the environment: Each service should have the least privilege possible to minimize unauthorized connections and access.

Centralize user identity and access control capabilities: Tight access control and centralized authentication mechanisms are essential for securing micro-services, since authentication is initiated at multiple points.

Isolate containers running micro-services from each other and the network: This includes both in transit and at rest data, since both can represent high-value targets for attackers.

Encrypt data between apps and services: A container orchestration platform with integrated security features helps minimize the chance of unauthorized access.

Introduce secure API gateways: Secure APIs increase authorization and routing visibility. By reducing exposed APIs, organizations can reduce surfaces of attacks.”
