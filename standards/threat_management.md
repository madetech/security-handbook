# Threat Management Guidance

## Threat management
“Many modern threat management systems use the cybersecurity framework established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST provides comprehensive guidance to improve information security and cybersecurity risk management for private sector organizations. One of their guides, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CF), consists of standards and best practices. Five primary functions make up its core structure. They are to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover.
### Identify
Cybersecurity teams need a thorough understanding of the organization's most important assets and resources. The identify function includes categories, such as asset management, business environment, governance, risk assessment, risk management strategy and supply chain risk management.
### Protect
The protect function covers much of the technical and physical security controls for developing and implementing appropriate safeguards and protecting critical infrastructure. These categories are identity management and access control, awareness and training, data security, information protection processes and procedures, maintenance and protective technology.
### Detect
The detect function implements measures that alert an organization to cyberattacks. Detect categories include anomalies and events, continuous security monitoring and early detection processes.
### Respond
The respond function ensures an appropriate response to cyberattacks and other cybersecurity events. Categories include response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation and improvements.“ https://www.ibm.com/topics/threat-management
